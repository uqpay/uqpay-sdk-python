# API contract alignment

Target compatibility cohort: **4.0.0 (unreleased)**. This branch is prepared for review; no tag or package publication is implied.

Contract reference: [OpenAPI revision 1feb1d2](https://github.com/uqpay/uqpay-docs/tree/1feb1d26d032c53b79ab44a7d48e88c9a91d397d/docs).

## PIN management

`cards.reset_pin` calls `/v1/issuing/cards/pin`. Despite historical reset naming in the SDKs, omitting `type` means initial `SET`. Explicitly pass `RESET` to reset without the current PIN, or `UPDATE` with `old_pin` to verify the current PIN before changing it. Both PIN values must contain six digits. `old_pin` is prohibited for `SET` and `RESET`. Validation and supported operations remain server-authoritative.

A response with `request_status=SUCCESS` and `order_status=PROCESSING` means the request was accepted. Use `card_order_id` with the existing card order retrieval operation to obtain `SUCCESS` or `FAILED`; a failed PIN order may include `failure_code`. PIN orders do not contain amount or card currency.

The legacy `/v1/issuing/cards/manage/pin` operation retains its existing behavior. Its `RESET` means changing with the old PIN; when migrating to the new endpoint use `UPDATE`, not `RESET`. Do not send legacy four-digit PINs to the new endpoint.

### PIN eligibility and migration deadline

The frozen reference contract schedules retirement of `/v1/issuing/cards/manage/pin` for **2026-10-17**. Migrate the legacy `RESET` operation to `UPDATE` on `/v1/issuing/cards/pin`. This date is the published contract schedule; these client tests do not verify Production rollout or actual endpoint retirement.

The card must be active and unexpired. Wait for any PIN operation already processing on that card to finish before submitting another. The new PIN must not repeat a single digit, occur within the cardholder's phone number, or share its last four digits with the card number. For `UPDATE`, it must differ from the current PIN. These checks and card-specific operation support are server-authoritative; a typed request does not establish eligibility.

## RFI answers

Send the full `rfi_id`, including its prefix. A `TEXT` answer needs non-empty `text`; an `ATTACHMENT` answer contains uploaded file IDs in `attachments`.

## Simulated deposits

Supply `account_id` explicitly, together with `amount`, `currency` and `sender_swift_code`. The recipient must be active and verified. The SDK does not infer the recipient from credentials or request headers. This operation is Sandbox-only.

## Transaction detail

`settlement_status` is available on transaction detail, and may be absent from list items. Values are `UNKNOWN`, `UNSETTLED`, `SETTLED` and `NOT_APPLICABLE`. `SETTLED` means clearing has been recorded, including partial clearing; it does not confirm full settlement. `UNKNOWN` does not mean unsettled.

## Beneficiary checks

Provide at least one non-empty `account_number` or `iban`. Both are accepted; `account_number` takes precedence. For LOCAL currencies without a default clearing system (including CNH), supply both `bank_country_code` and `clearing_system`. The default-route currencies are USD, GBP, EUR, SGD, CAD, AUD, HKD, MYR, IDR, PHP and INR. For SWIFT, use `clearing_system=SWIFT`. Validation is server-authoritative.

## Card art updates

Card updates accept `card_art_id` and `name_on_card`. Card art changes apply to virtual and physical cards; both `card_status` and `processing_status` must be `ACTIVE`. An accepted `PROCESSING` response is asynchronous: use `card_order_id` to check the final result.

## Request and webhook handling

`CheckBeneficiaryParams` allows IBAN-only requests and exposes `bank_country_code`; the server enforces the requirement for at least one non-empty account identifier.

Webhook verification returns the original parsed data, including nulls, unknown values and decimal strings. Signed fixtures cover all 26 payment method types in the reference contract.

## Boundary and response regression coverage

Offline fixtures exercise all three KYC entry points (create cardholder, update cardholder and create card with inline cardholder fields). They cover all six proof providers, reference lengths 9/10/64/65 and birth dates corresponding to ages 17/18/79/80 on 2026-09-17. These tests prove that the SDK preserves the submitted values; server acceptance, current configuration and environment rollout still require Sandbox verification. Inline cardholder fields include email, first/last name and country code.

Card list pagination preserves page sizes 1, 10 and 100. Banking list page sizes are 1–100. Currency conversions require a fresh quote per operation: `FUNDS_ARRIVED` is intermediate and `TRADE_SETTLED` is the successful terminal state.

Payment intent retrieval supports per-request `x-on-behalf-of` without requiring a caller-supplied idempotency key. Existing automatic GET header behavior remains language-specific; the contract no longer requires the header but does not prohibit it. POST idempotency and retry behavior remain unchanged.

Card creation orders use `CREATE_CARD`. Issuing transfer REST status uses uppercase `PENDING`/`FAILED`/`COMPLETED`; transfer webhook status is a distinct lowercase field. Wallet values remain open strings, including empty and unknown values. The SDK does not infer transaction context from them.

Response fixtures preserve company summaries, individual details, negative decimal strings, payer ID `"0"`, empty identification types, JSON-text card metadata and nullable objects. Payment GET requests omit the idempotency header; mutating requests retain it.

## Acquiring GET headers

Offline route-specific checks cover D189–D196: balance list/detail, bank account list/detail, payout list/detail, settlements list and payment intent detail. Each call is exercised with and without `x-on-behalf-of`, while preserving the configured `x-client-id`. Callers need not supply an idempotency key for these GET requests; existing automatic GET headers remain supported. Existing POST idempotency and retry tests remain part of verification.

## Banking balance precision

Offline D122–D129 fixtures cover `available_balance`, `frozen_balance`, `margin_balance` and `prepaid_balance` through both list and detail reads. Each field receives zero with trailing decimal places, a positive amount, a negative amount, large positive/negative amounts, and a long decimal string. Distinct values across fields detect accidental swaps; comparisons retain strings and precision. Long decimal fixtures test client robustness, not server-supported currency precision. CLI verification covers JSON output.

## Acquiring nullable responses

Offline fixtures distinguish missing fields, explicit null, empty strings/objects and populated controls. REST checks cover payment attempts, refunds and payouts. Empty REST event times remain strings. Webhook fixtures exercise intent, attempt, refund, payout and chargeback alert families; empty timestamps or incomplete objects are robustness probes, not claims of server-valid payloads.

Signed Webhook fixtures preserve raw data and reject a payload whose bytes change after signing. This is offline verification, not evidence of event delivery from Sandbox.

## Cardholder KYC event interpretation

For `cardholder.kyc.status_changed`, use `data.cardholder_status` to determine the outcome: `SUCCESS` is approved, `FAILED` is rejected, and `INCOMPLETE` requires additional information. The optional or empty `data.reason` explains rejection or a request for more information; its presence alone does not determine the outcome.
